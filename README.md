# Layoffs Data Cleaning and Analysis (MySQL) and creating visualizations using Python_mysql_connector.

### Objective:

The objective of this project is to clean and analyze a dataset containing information about company layoffs, stored in a MySQL database. The project will involve extracting the data, cleaning it to ensure accuracy and consistency, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and creating visualizations using Python libraries such as Pandas and Plotly.

### Dataset Description:

The dataset includes records related to layoffs at various companies. Typical fields in the dataset may include:

Company Name: Name of the company where the layoffs occurred

Industry: Industry sector of the company

Number of Employees Laid Off: Number of employees affected by the layoff

Percentage: Total number of employees  layoffs in Percent

Layoff Date: Date of the layoff event

Stage: Role of Employee (e.g., POST-IPO, Series-E)

Location: Location of the company or affected offices

Fund Raised: Funds raised in millions


### Data Collection:

Connect to the MySQL database and extract the layoff data.

Import the data into a suitable environment for data cleaning .

### Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values: Identify and fill or remove missing data points.

Standardize data formats: Ensure all date fields and categorical variables are in a consistent format.

Remove duplicates: Identify and remove duplicate records.

Outlier detection and treatment: Detect outliers in numerical fields and decide on their treatment.

Correct inaccuracies: Verify and correct any inaccuracies in the data (e.g., incorrect layoff dates, company names).

Data type conversion: Convert data types as necessary (e.g., convert numeric fields to integers/floats).

### Data Analysis:

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, patterns, and relationships in the data.

Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation) for numerical variables.

Examine the distribution of categorical variables (e.g., Industry).

Conduct correlation analysis to understand relationships between numerical variables.

### Data Visualization:

Use Plotly Express (px) for creating interactive and static visualizations.

Histograms and Bar Charts: Visualize the distribution of layoffs across different companies and industries.

Box Plots: Display the spread and detect outliers in the number of employees laid off.

Scatter Plots: Explore relationships between pairs of numerical variables.

Line Plots: Show correlation matrices to visualize relationships between variables.

Pie Plots: Visualize trends in Avg_layoffs.

### Reporting:

Compile the findings into a comprehensive report.

Use visualizations to support and illustrate key points.

Ensure the report is clear and accessible to all stakeholders.

### Tools and Technologies:

MySQL: For data extraction.

Python: Using libraries like Pandas for data manipulation and Plotly for visualization.

MySQL Connector: For connecting to the MySQL database from Python.

Jupyter Notebook: For documenting the analysis process in an interactive environment.

### Deliverables:

A cleaned and validated dataset stored in MySQL.

A MySQL Server documenting the data cleaning and analysis process.

A Jupyter Notebook for Visulatizations of analysis process.

Interactive and static visualizations illustrating key aspects of the data.

A comprehensive report summarizing the data cleaning steps, findings, and recommendations.

By the end of this project, you will have a high-quality dataset ready for analysis and reporting, ensuring accurate insights into company layoff trends and their impacts.
